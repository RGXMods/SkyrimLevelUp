# SkyrimLevelUp

SkyrimLevelUp is a standalone WoW addon that plays a Skyrim-inspired sound on `PLAYER_LEVEL_UP`. It is not a Better Level-Up sound pack. The TOC set covers Retail (`120100`), Classic Era (`11509`), Burning Crusade Classic (`20506`), Wrath of the Lich King Classic (`38002`), Cataclysm Classic (`40402`), Mists of Pandaria Classic (`50504`), and WoW Forever (`16001`), and requires `RGX-Framework`.

## Layout And Runtime

- The TOC loads `data/locales.lua` before `data/core.lua`; preserve that order.
- `data/core.lua` registers the addon with `RGX:GetSound()` and owns events and `/srlu` commands.
- `sounds/` contains the high, medium, and low sound variants; `media/` contains branding assets.
- `docs/CHANGES.md` and `docs/changelogs/` contain release notes.

## Development Rules

- Use the existing RGX sound handle, event registration, and slash-command APIs rather than duplicating sound state or lifecycle plumbing.
- Keep localization fallbacks intact and match the surrounding Lua style.
- Keep `SkyrimLevelUp.toc` and `ADDON_VERSION` in `data/core.lua` synchronized when changing versions.

## Testing And Release

- There is no build step or automated test suite. Install the addon and `RGX-Framework` in each supported client flavor being changed. Verify `/srlu help`, `/srlu test`, enable/disable, all three sound variants, persistence after `/reload`, and an actual or simulated level-up event.
- Stable releases use `vX.Y.Z` tags. `.github/workflows/release.yml` validates the tag against the TOC version and packages with BigWigsMods/packager; pushes to `dev` and `alpha` use those release channels. Update `docs/CHANGES.md` and the matching `docs/changelogs/<version>.md` entry for a release.

## Repository Workflow

- The GitLab project under `rgxmods/warcraft` is authoritative. Normal work belongs on task branches and must merge through GitLab merge requests, never directly to the default branch.
- Shared CI is included from `rgxmods/warcraft/RGX-Framework` at `/.gitlab/ci/addon.yml`; validation must pass before publishing to the GitHub mirror.
- The GitHub `RGXMods` repository is downstream distribution, not development authority.
- Keep GitLab and GitHub release tags identical, and use protected GitLab release tags.
- Preserve any existing working Wago connection and ID exactly. Never create a new Wago connection without explicit user direction.
- Publishing integrations prohibited by the shared validation policy are retired and must not be restored.
- The root `README.md` must remain detailed and project-specific. Narrow distribution edits must not replace or truncate installation, features, compatibility, usage, media, or support content.
- Verify relative README assets. Do not overwrite newer compatibility facts with stale monorepo or history text.
